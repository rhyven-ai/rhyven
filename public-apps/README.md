# Rhyven apps

Open-source headless applications for the Rhyven runtime. All Rhyven-authored
app materials in this repository are licensed under **Apache-2.0**. The Rhyven
engine is also open source under Apache-2.0, in the separate
[rhyven-ai/rhyven repository](https://github.com/rhyven-ai/rhyven).

CI Management records pipeline state; it does not execute builds. Messaging and Repo Documentation Tool use container images. Check the
[public registry](https://github.com/rhyven-ai/registry) for installable versions
and immutable image digests; publishing source does not release a new image.

## Use or modify an app

Install a compatible Rhyven binary separately. These apps use manifest format 2
and the three-tool interface. Use Rhyven 0.8.0 for the new review and monitoring apps. Linux is the tested container platform; check the runtime's platform
requirements and license terms. No Rust source build is needed to author an app.

From this repository's root:

```sh
rhyven app validate catalog/inventory.json
rhyven app test catalog/inventory.json
rhyven app package catalog/inventory.json --out /tmp/inventory.rhyven.json
# Review permissions before accepting installation.
rhyven --home ./trial-state --collection demo install /tmp/inventory.rhyven.json --accept-permissions
rhyven --home ./trial-state --collection demo call rhyven_describe '{"category":"rhyven/inventory"}'
```

For a container app, follow its README to build the image, package the immutable
image ID and run `app test --allow-container`. A local image ID only works on
that host. Distribution needs a pullable repository digest. Python and language
servers are inside the image; recipients need Docker, not host language runtimes.

To publish a modified app, choose your own app ID/publisher namespace, update the
guide and behavior tests, and retain the license/notices. Record modifications.
The license grants no general permission to brand a fork as a Rhyven product.
App state belongs to the selected local collection; do not commit it here.

## Agent interface

Apps share `rhyven_categories()`, `rhyven_describe(category)`, and
`rhyven_call(category, function, args)`. The category is an installed app ID.
Read its description for current function schemas and guidance. Agents can
coordinate tasks, knowledge and messages without app-specific MCP servers.

Give your agent the [Use Rhyven skill](skills/use-rhyven/SKILL.md), or merge the
shorter [usage rule](skills/use-rhyven/RULE.md) into its supported project
instructions. Both cover discovery, collection selection, marketplace approval
and app operations. Preserve existing instructions; neither file changes client
configuration or grants installation consent by itself.

## Build your own

- [Declarative app skill](skills/build-rhyven-declarative-app/SKILL.md)
- [Native Python and JavaScript skill](skills/build-rhyven-script-app/SKILL.md)
- [Native Python example](examples/script-python/README.md)
- [Native JavaScript example](examples/script-javascript/README.md)
- [On-demand container skill, including Dockerfile](skills/build-rhyven-container-app/SKILL.md)
- [Persistent service skill, including Dockerfile](skills/build-rhyven-service-app/SKILL.md)
- [Publishing skill](skills/publish-rhyven-app/SKILL.md)
- [Small Python action example](examples/container-python/README.md)
- [Persistent Python example](examples/container-service-python/README.md)

`examples/remote-inventory.rhyven.json` is an experimental loopback contract
fixture, not a hosted service or an advertised v1 backend.

## Tests

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s apps/starter-runner/tests -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s apps/messaging/tests -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s apps/repo-documentation-tool/tests -v
```

The tests listed above need only Python's standard library. Change Verifier's tests also require pytest 9.0.3. Docker integration tests
need the runtime binary and a built image; see each app's README. The documentation
app's external toolchains are downloaded only during image builds.

For dependency licensing and image distribution obligations, read
[THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md). Report security issues privately through the
[registry security channel](https://github.com/rhyven-ai/registry/security/advisories/new).
Do not attach credentials, customer repositories, app state or private reports
to public issues. Contributions should include tests and use Apache-2.0 terms.

## Optional starter apps

Existing harnesses can use all general apps through the same three tools. Users
without a harness can add [Starter Runner](apps/starter-runner/README.md), which
connects their own model API to tasks, knowledge and user questions. It requires
Docker. [User Questions](apps/user-questions/README.md) is a separate declarative
app, also useful to existing harnesses. Neither is required for ordinary app use.

## Review and onboarding

Design Review stores tasks and proposals for the connected harness; it does not
call a second model API. Change Verifier checks supplied Python code before and
after a change. Customer Onboarding Monitor tracks documents, replies and
deadlines in a durable inbox. A configured runner can receive optional webhook
notifications. All three store results that another agent can inspect.

Pallet tooling is retired in Rhyven 0.8. Complete apps and app workflows remain.
Existing saved source and historical releases are retained.
